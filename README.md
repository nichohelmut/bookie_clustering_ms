> I am applying the Archetype Analysis(AA) as part of the feature engineering.
> The AA is a way of dimensionality reduction to point out in a dataset, a certain number of archetypes. 
> Classical archetypes to be expected are high performing clubs like Real Madrid or Bayern Munich. 
> But also, medium and low preforming clubs can create archetypes in certain combinations of data, which can help to describe similarly performing teams.

> I adapted it a little bit, to better suite my usecase.
